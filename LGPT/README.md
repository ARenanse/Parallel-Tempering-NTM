# Langevin Gradient Parallel Tempering for Bayesian Neural Learning
Langevin Gradient Parallel Tempering (Chandra et al, < arXiv:1811.04343v1 >) from ground up as an Abstract Base Class. 

*In Progress. Final loop is the only thing left to implement in ParallelTemperingClass.py, besides the usual Stabilization Issues that is Intrinsic to BNL.*

*TODO: Documentation on HOW TO USE and Methodology of Implementation.*
